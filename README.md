**Quasiclass** -- simulation of proton-coupled electron transfer with a presence of bath.

The code randomizes a large number of initial trajectories guided by coherent state and temperature distributions. The trajectories are propagated using Hamilton's equations of motion. The average quantity in the end shows an overall dynamics with presence of quantum effects.
